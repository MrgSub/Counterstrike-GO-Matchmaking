#CS:GO Competitive Server Blocker

Use this program to pick what competitive servers you want to play on competitive. Since the servers are blocked in the firewall there is no risk of a VAC ban.

1: Click the servers you want to play

2: Press "Apply"

#Unblocking

1: Press "Reset"

2: Close the application


#Limitations:-

Software needs to be ran as administrator since it changes your firewall options to block other servers.

You must be running MS firewall otherwise it won't work 100%

You may have to increase your maximum match making ping in the game menu.
